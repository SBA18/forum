## Laravel 5.3 Forum

This is the Laravel 5.3 version of a previous forum I made. It is going to include basically the same features and some more, though it is going to be much cleaner (both in code and in design).

Stay tuned; Laravel 5.3 has not yet been released.

> **If you want to download the old version, switch to the `5.2` branch. I believe it still may have some bugs, so don't bother.**
