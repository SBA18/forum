# Laravel 5.2 Forum

This is a simple Laravel 5.2 Forum that I am working on.

I hope to have the following functionality (strikethrough signifies completion):
- ~~Base Laravel 5.2 Authentication~~
- ~~Customised base Laravel 5.2 Authentication~~
- ~~User profile customisation~~~
  - ~~First / Last name~~
  - ~~Location~~
  - ~~Website~~
  - ~~Biography~~
  - User profile image (Uploadcare)
- User permissions / groups
- Forum posts
  - Categories
    - Category create/edit/delete ***(admin feature)***
    - Category selection
  - Locked to specific user groups
- ...
