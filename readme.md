# Laravel 5.2 Forum

This is a very simple Laravel 5.2 forum that I am working on.

It is for personal-use only, so the features and functionality are limited to my own abilities and creativity.

(For just starting out with Laravel, I think I am doing pretty well.)

It uses Bootstrap 3 and a few PHP dependencies.

This is the checklist of functionality I wish to have for this project. A strikethrough signifies completion.
