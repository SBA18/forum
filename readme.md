# Laravel 5.3 Forum

This is the Laravel 5.3 version of a previous forum I made. It is going to include basically the same features and some more, though it is going to be much cleaner (both in code and in design).

> **If you would still like to download the older version, switch to the `5.2` branch and clone it.**

> Now that I actually have a working knowledge of the Laravel framework, I would advise against using the old version; it is sloppy and unorganized. There are much better techniques I could have used.

This new version will be much better.

Update:

So I started development on this; as you can see. 

I set up a random domain and installed it there. Every so often I will pull changes to the server. So [here is the demo](https://bloard.ga).
