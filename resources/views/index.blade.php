        <h1>Forum</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this forum. It is built in Laravel 5.2 and includes lots of features.</p>
        <p>I, <a href="http://zaknesler.com/">Zak Nesler</a>, made this over many hours of work. This is my first large Laravel project.</p>
        <p>I also might as well plug the website where I learned Laravel from; <a href="https://www.codecourse.com">Codecourse</a>. I highly recommend that you check the website out, it has many tutorials for web development and an active and helpful community.</p>
        <p>Check out the GitHub page for this project if you haven't already: <a href="https://github.com/zaknes/forum">github.com/zaknes/forum</a>.</p>
